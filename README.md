## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEMIT (ITCSS & BEM)
- SASS with scss syntax
- Layouts without media queries (Grid containers)
- Atomic design components

### What I learned

I use this project to learn some layouts without media queries, something that could be pretty tricky but really joyful.

I use different math expressions in css to control columns number and the wrap moment:

```scss
 grid-template-columns: repeat(
        auto-fit,
        minmax(clamp(100%/ (2 + 1) + 0.1%, (#{layout.$md-bp} - 100vw) * 1000, 100%), 1fr)
    );
```

```scss
flex: max(375px, 50%);
```

### Continued development

I used this Atomic design mixed with a BEMIT method for this project. Sometimes the fact of apply this methodology could be hard beacuse when the design project is not really defined that way, i gotta figure out wich component belongs to which group (Atoms, molecules and organisms). I would love to keep improving in that!
